# Algorithms-Design-and-Analysis

###Algorithms: Design and Analysis (Stanford University), Part 1
This is an undergraduate course on the design and analysis of
algorithms. The main topics are: asymptotic analysis, divide and
conquer algorithms, sorting and searching, basic randomized
algorithms, graph search, shortest paths, heaps, search trees, and
hash tables.

###Algorithms: Design and Analysis (Stanford University), Part 2
This course covers greedy algorithms, including applications to
minimum spanning trees and Huffman codes; dynamic
programming, including applications to sequence alignment and
shortest-path problems; and exact and approximation algorithms
for NP-complete problems.
